<p>I’m currently a developer for Texas Blockchain as part of the Labs Division. We participate in
blockchain hackathons which focus on particular technologies built by the host of the hackathon,
such as Chainlink and EthOnline. We mainly use Soldiity to build Ethereum-based smart contracts
and typical front-end technologies such as React.</p>
<p>I’m also a part of Acts College Fellowship, a church organization and community of which I spend
most of my free time with. I’m hoping to serve in the media/tech ministry as a way to contribute
to this community in a meaningful way I’m passionate about.<br>
