# My thoughts #
I felt like this course was challenging but still completely doable as a student who had some decent
programming knowledge in high school but hadn't ever touched Java. The effort put into the course is
well rewarded by the knowledge you gain. This course can definitely be challenging and confusing at times
but the structure of the content and the practice material given allowed me to understand with enough
repitition. The material I learned in this course gave me a deeper understanding of Computer Science as a
whole and I feel like it adequately prepared me for future CS courses.

This course was taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/">Mike Scott</a>, a professor who's incredibly passionate and engaging. Mike knows
how to teach the course and knows the material very well. He doesn't make the 50 minute lecture boring
at any time and is always enthusiastic about what he's teaching. He uses slideshows for notes so there's
less time taking notes and more time understanding. The only drawback with his teaching style is that he
can be a bit fast at times, moving on before many of us can comprehend the material fully. However, this 
is mostly out of his control as there is a strict schedule to stick to.

Assignments varied from trivial (data structure implementations) to extremely difficult and confusing 
(compressing algorithms). However, the assignments were thorough and helped me understand the data structures
we were learning even more. We are given a week to complete them and they took me approximately 10 to 20 hours 
to finish, including implementing, checking, and visiting office hours.

# What we covered #
Data structures are **bolded** and ideas presented are in more-or-less chronological order.
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Algorithm Analysis (calculating T(N) and Big-O of functions)
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Java Techniques and Characteristics
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Syntax, Encapsulation, Inheritance, 
Polymorphism, Generics, Iterators
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Interfaces
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Abstract Classes
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Lists** (ArrayLists, Linked-Lists)
5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Maps**
6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Recursion and Recursive Backtracking
7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Searching and Sorting
8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Linear, Selection, Insertion, Mergesort, 
Quicksort, Radix Sort
9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Stacks**
10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Queues** (and Priority Queues)
11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Binary Trees**
12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Binary Search Trees**
13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Red Black Trees**
14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Huffman Coding (Compression Algorithm)
15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Graphs**
16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Hash Tables**
17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Tries**
18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Heaps**
19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Dynamic Programming
20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Functional Programming  

<br/>

# Hardest concepts in the class #
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\. Recursive Backtracking
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2\. Rarely used concepts such as Abstract Classes (in my experience)
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3\. Huffman's Compression Algorithm

<br/>

# Conclusion #
This class was made interesting and fun because of Mike but I also found the content to be extremely
valuable and necessary. This course can be challenging but with enough effort and determination, a 
strong grade in the course isn't unrealistic. Additionally, help and resources were readily available
and extremely easy to access.
