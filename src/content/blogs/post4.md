# Background #
This past December was my first winter break from college and I spent a good chunk of it learning
about the Web3 world. Having experience from the Fall semester building smart contracts for Texas
Blockchain, I had a grasp in how they work and how they fit in into the whole crypto space. This 
was the technical knowledge, but I needed to gain more **general** knowledge.  

What ecosystems are gaining traction? What technologies are people building and why? What's the point of all this Web3 nonsense anyways? Why are people getting five and six figures for some trivial tasks?  

Some things had been stirring within the crypto world as I began to dive deeper into it. An
ecosystem called <a target="_blank" href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a> had been gaining 
attention for some time now, and December would be one of its greatest rallies. A few events
had brought the greater crypto attention (and capital) into the ecosystem, such as the <a target="_blank" href="https://blockworks.co/news/jito-airdrop-value">Jito airdrop</a> that 
gave a free $20k+ to everyone who staked with the protocol.  

**There's only going to be more opportunities...**

# Crypto the Guide #
As I researched the different ecosystems, it became difficult to gather and organize all the different information that I was receiving. That's when I teamed up with my brother to create 
a website that would have all the information an amateur or seasoned veteran would need. We 
wanted to have it as a public tool that anyone could refer to when they forget what protocols,
bridges, and websites they can use when integrating into an ecosystem. We noticed much of this
information was spread out everywhere: Twitter threads, Medium articles, Discord messages, etc.
We didn't want people to have to bookmark a bunch of stuff just to remember how to navigate
through an ecosystem. This is one of the things we wanted centralized in a decentralized world.

# Bitcoin ETF #
Recently, the Bitcoin exchanged-traded fund (ETF) was approved on January 10th, 2024. This
essentially opened the doors of crypto to a larger audience. Most likely, this would mean 
more capital coming into the crypto markets and prices would go up. News of the process of 
the Bitcoin ETF being approved created a several month long rally throughout the Fall of 2023
that increase Bitcoin's price from $26k to $45k. Alt markets such as Ethereum and Solana 
benefitted as well, making substantial gains during the same period. As the expected and
eventual date of the ETF approval came, the news of the approval was leaked through a SIM swap
hack of the SEC's twitter account and led to a spike and then a dump in price. Now, a few
weeks have passed since the ETF approval and the crypto market has been bloody red. The outcome
of the news was rather anti-climactic, as there was minimal price action and people had already
known through the leaked tweets. 

# What's the future? #
Everything's in the red, but this dip and market correction was expected. People sold the news
and now prices are consolidating. However, there are a lot of talks about an upcoming bull run. 
Whether we've already started, I'm not sure. One of the major bullish narratives Bitcoin and the
whole crypto community has right now is the Bitcoin halving projected to happen in April 2024. 
The halving will "half" the block reward for mining Bitcoin, increasing its scarcity and price, 
at least in theory.
