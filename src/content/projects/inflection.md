# Background #
ETH Denver is one of, if not the largest crypto and web3 convention in North America. This is where many web3 companies come to showcase and present their projects to investors, developers, and enthusiasts. They also host a hackathon to allow developers to build on specific platforms or chains and to learn more about new technologies. As part of the Labs Division of Texas Blockchain, we came out to Denver to participate in the hackathon to win some bounties and meet different teams and companies.

# Purpose #
The purpose of Inflection is to allow anyone to create a fundraising campaign without fears of being deplatformed or censored. We also wanted to create a platform that also allowed users to create multiple efficient financial coordination campaigns: Anything Helps, Goal-Based, Per Person, and Split Fixed Cost.

# Challenges #
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\. Using bounty SDKs

One challenge of building Inflection was the unreliability of the different bounty SDKs. We had to learn their SDK, install it, and implement it into our project. Documentation for many of these SDKs were lacking and much of what we wanted required us to figure it out ourselves. This was made even harder as these SDKs were built on technology by the company but was often spotty and broken. Pair that with a lack of documentation and it was an impossible problem to debug. 

# Prizes #
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Connect the World with Chainlink ($2,000)
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- okto: Third Place: Consumer DApps ($1,000)
