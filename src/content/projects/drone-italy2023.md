# Overview #
A drone documentary of my travels to Italy in the Summer of 2023.

# Purpose #
To capture the beauty of the landscape and nature within Italy from a unique perspective.

# How it was made #
As my family and I travelled through Italy's countryside and visited its natural wonders, I would
capture the moment by pulling out the drone and setting up to fly. In my mind, I'm thinking about
all the different shots I want to capture and envisioning the different scenes I could make with
the landscape surrounding me. I try to take slow cinematic shots of the scenery as well as fast 
action scenes like going through holes or over obstacles.

After gathering the drone shots from the whole trip, I import them into my computer and start editing
them together to create a natural and satisfying flow. I split differetn clips and merge them together
to tell a story almost. After the clips are meshed, I added some polishing touches and music and sound
effects to make the video more immersive, such as the sound of air blowing.

# Challenges #
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\. Getting the drone shots
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2\. Video editing

A challenge when building this project was getting the drone shots I envisioned as reality is not always
up to expectations. Additionally, the drone is also limited by wind conditions and radio connectivity
which made some shots freeze and be impossible to get unless I risked losing the drone. In the process
of getting cooler shots, there were also some close calls such as almost crashing into a rock wall when
getting the scene through a cliff hole.

Another unexpected challenge was the video editing. Having made videos in the past, I expected using
IMovie to be quite simple and straightforward but some of the aspects of the application such as the 
dedicated track for background music made it difficult and frustrating to work with. I also encountered
some problems with splitting clips which would unintentionally split audio and mess up the ordering.
Another major annoyance and frustration of IMovie was the lack of information the audio waveform would
provide for split clips. Traditionally, the split clips would have their own separate audio and the
waveform would be discrete and match it intuitively but in IMovie, the waveform would try to connect the
split clips, making the process a lot more confusing.
