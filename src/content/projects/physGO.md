# Overview #
Graphic organizers that I made during my junior and senior year of high school while I was taking AP Physics. They follow Collegeboard's physics curriculum and
separated by units. Each unit has a fundamental part consisting of necessary vocab, then showcases
every major concept with examples, cases, and scenarios. At the end of each unit are tips I found
useful for problem-solving.

# Purpose #
These graphic organizers originally started out as a way to help my classmates, but it quickly 
became my own study tool as well. As physics became harder to learn, I continued breaking it 
down and structuring lecture notes in a way that would help me comprehend the material. It became
my way for study for tests, as I was essentially teaching myself the material. It also forced
me to reread all the notes in a detailed manner so that I could summarize and visualize onto the
graphic organizer.

# How it was made #

Using plain old Google Docs, everything was typed, formatted, and created to build the graphic 
organizer. For pictures, they were created by taking a screenshot of some white space, and 
created soley in MacOS' screenshot preview editor. An extremely crude and naive approach in 
hindsight but still managed to get the information across.  

# Challenges #
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\. Handdrawing each picture
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2\. Consistency
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3\. Formatting

A recurring challenge within this project was the need to draw out every picture. More often than not, the
physics scenarios we had gone over in class had no Google image representation without hours of scouring.
This meant I had to create my own original drawings, in a digitized format. At the time, the easiest 
solution to me was simply using a screenshot preview editor

Being consistent was also difficult as I tried to make all the pages as uniform as possible. This was hard
as this project was being worked on over the course of a year and Google Docs unfortunately doesn't support
CSS. With enough time and effort, I eventually ironed out some of the bigger formatting discrepancies and overall, 
I believe the consistentcy is at a level where most people wouldn't mind.

Formatting on Google Docs was also a pain. A single page could only allow so much
information as it had to be legible and the aligning of text and pictures don't easily snap into a satisfying
grid. Some of these drawbacks made it difficult to maintain consistency and formatting ultimately became a
larger problem than actually studying the physics I was summarizing. 

# Impact #
I presented my work to my high school physics teacher Mr. Khan, and to my surprise, he offered to audit the 
graphic organizer for correctness and overall coherence. I was thrilled to have my work be recognized and 
appreciated. An even greater surprise was a monetary trade for the rights to use this work in his teaching
for the future. He said he planned to use my work (and Manim Animation) as an additional tool and resource to 
help future AP Physics students learn the concepts in the notoriously difficult subject. 

For now, I'm placing these graphic organizers here for free in the hopes that it may reach someone who needs
it.
