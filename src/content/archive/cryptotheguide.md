# Overview #
A guide to the Web 3 universe.

# Purpose #
To help people learn about the different ecosystems they might want to navigate to. 
The guide also serves to centralize answers of the most frequently asked questions 
regarding Web 3, making learning and navigating easier. It also provides a platform for
me to publish my research of different ecosystems so I can easily refer back to it if
I need to use it myself.

# How it was made #
This guide initially started out as a GitBook, a platform to easily publish article-styled pages in
an organized manner, including steps to show people how to use certain tools with GIFs and descriptions.
We continued this up to 33 different guides, covering the Solana ecosystem extensively, until we 
realized this wasn't a scalable or practical solution. We found each guide to be too tedious for those
who know the Web3 world and too repetitive and simple for newbies.

We changed the guides from steps on how to do something (ex: staking SOL on Marinade Finance) to each
ecosystem having its own page and showcasing all the different protocols, tools, and useful information
that one may need for that specific ecosystem. We found this to be a lot more helpful not just to others
but for ourselves as well. The information was organized well enough to have a person familiar with Web 3
to quickly pick up the different parts of an ecosystem. We felt like this met our targeted audience to 
a greater extent and was a much more scalable solution.

# Challenges #
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\. Researching complex ecosystems
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2\. Working with so many different ecosystems

Researching complex ecosystems can be complicated. Many of these large scale projects often feature a lot
of derivatives and smaller components and it continues to cascade down into dozens of possible rabbit holes.
Many projects have different tokens, names, themes, slang, and culture. Sometimes, it becomes overwhelming
to understand all the different ways ecosystems and projects will describe the same things. This complexity
makes it hard to sift through the unecessary information and make it clear how the ecosystem should be organized
so that someone can easily navigate it using our guide.

Another challenge was researching and working with so many different ecosystems as many of them have their own 
chains, protocols, platforms, and personalities. Knowing how to even bridge over to a certain chain could
sometimes be confusing and ensuring that we were covering the vastness of each ecosystem proved to be difficult.
We strove to cover the popular protocols that people would use or certainly need to know in order to be familiar
with that ecosystem but even this could sometimes be challenging.
