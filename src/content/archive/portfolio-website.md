# Overview #
A website displaying all the work that I'm proud to share with those willing to
see. From small side projects to large collaborative efforts, this website includes
it all. Most of the projects on here are technical but certainly doesn't exclude the 
non-technical projects I've found passion and interest in.

# Purpose #
This website was created to showcase my work while being an opportunity to learn more
about frontend development and the Astro framework.

# How it was made and its challenges #
In summary, this website was built on hours of reading documentation, analyzing 
template code, and implementing features I had seen for the first time. Then the
website was deployed onto the internet using Netlify. Challenges
largely included the visual aesthetic of the website, or lack thereof, and learning
all the tools used in this project.

Detailed documentation of this project can be found at its
