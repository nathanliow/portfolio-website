# My thoughts #
I thought this class was a fair and average class with nothing too notable about it.
This course had certain characteristics that I liked but also didn't like. I liked how
there were lecture videos to help you gain an understanding of the material before diving
deeper into it during class. However, I didn't like the course content because of how 
ambigious and freeforming it is. For example, proofs can be done in a very structured manner
or in a way that just requires some logical reasoning written down in a few sentences. It was
kind of like a knowledge and wisdom you can only gain with time and experience in order to
answer questions right easily and quickly.

This class was taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/devangi-parikh">Dr. Parikh</a>
who is a very nice and good professor. She places an emphasis on not worrying about grades but only out
of the reason that she wants you to learn the content rather than studying for exams. This is
understandable but grades are still very important to an extent. Ocassionally, questions
may be asked and Dr. Parikh doesn't give a very concrete or satisfying answer that will help us
understand the concept better, but that can be attributed to the very open-ended nature of the
content. She does allow a notesheet to be used on exams and quizzes which also help you learn
and remember the plethora of theorems, techniques, proofs, and random vocabulary. 

Homeworks were relatively short compared to CS314 but they were still worksheets with several
problems covering the content learned in the past week or so. Homework solutions were provdied
and the whole system was curated to help you learn from the homeworks rather than practice and
apply what you've learned. This is because some of the homework problems are simply too hard and
complex for any average student to come up with an adequate solution in a reasonable amount of time.
After revisiting old homeworks from the beginning of the semester, they became more and more
obvious and easier to solve, and at that point they could be used for practice for the final.

We also had weekly quizzes that were simple and easy during discussion sections. The quizzes and 
TAs were also very helpful in clearing up any confusion and even providing rules of thumbs and tips 
to problem-solving in this class.

# Hardest concepts in the class #
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\. Implication Terminology
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2\. Induction
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3\. Graphs

At the beginning of the semester, understanding how to turn implications into english and vice versa was difficult
to grasp as there was a giant list of words and phrases that would mean an implication. Also understanding 
the difference between sufficent and necessary was more complicated than I would ever think. If something is necessary,
it is the consequent of an implication and if it is sufficient, it is the antecendent of an implication.  
1. For example:
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need water in order to make rice"
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is necessary
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having rice implies I had water
5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R -> W
6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I have water, I can make rice"
7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is sufficient
8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having water implies I can make rice
9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W -> R

Another source of headaches from the course was understanding induction, specifically strong and structural induction.
Induction as a whole is the largest concept to grasp and regurgitate as the proofs you make with induction is 
essentially at least a page long. The idea of induction is that you prove base cases, then you induct or iterate to show that 
something is true for the next iteration. Naturally, these long proofs took some time to understand each component and 
why it was necessary to be there. Especially with structural induction, the free-flowing nature of the concept just made it
extremely hard to know whether I was doing it right. Structural induction essentially deals with something you can't 
necessarily iterate through or get to the next step, most commonly like abstract structures.

Graphs was also a large unit covered within the course as there were so many aspects about them. Ranging from the types
of graphs to the different characteristics within each type of graph. It was a lot to keep track of but eventually, we
had to construct proofs about them. More common proofs involved justifying the number of edges for a given number of 
vertices or justifying a certain number of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring">chromatic colors</a> 
with a certain type of graph.

# Conclusion #  
Personally, I found this class to be relatively easy in terms of content as it approaches simply pattern matching.
The content wasn't as detailed as CS314 but there were still difficulties. You would still need to work for the
grade you want and overall a well-needed and fundamental course for a computer science major. Sometimes lecture
can still be quite boring however.
