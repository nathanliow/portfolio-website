# On campus activites #
I'm currently the Director of the Labs Division for Texas Blockchain. I work to build educational content for new club members to understand more about crypto on a technical level. I also work on creating a hackathon schedule for our team throughout the year. We participate in blockchain hackathons which focus on particular technologies built by the host of the hackathon,
such as Chainlink and EthOnline. We mainly use Soldiity to build Ethereum-based smart contracts 
and typical front-end technologies such as React.

I'm also a part of Acts College Fellowship, a church organization and community of which I spend
most of my free time with. I'm currently serving as a Leader-In-Training to help lead small groups that meet weekly. I'm also hoping to serve in the media/tech ministry as a way to contribute
to this community in a meaningful way.

# Interests and Hobbies #
I love to hang out with friends and bond over late night food runs. I also love photography, 
especially time-lapses and drone photography. In fact, check out my
